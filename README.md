# DL_NLP_EIB_Project
This repo is used for a deep learning project to study the climate-related risk disclosures from companies around the world. <br>
We continue to working on a project from last year and the raw data comes from the team from last year as well.<br>
The data has company tickers and the corresponding texts from annual reports, sustainability reports, and investor presentations in 2018.<br>

We used the following packages in our code:<br>

gensim ('4.1.2') ## We used this package to generate keywords that were similar to our pre-defined keywords for the target clusters.<br>
nltk ('3.6.5')<br>
numpy ('1.19.5')<br>
pandas ('1.2.2')<br>
re ('2.2.1')<br>
seaborn ('0.11.2')<br>
transformers ('4.15.0') ## We used the BERT-related models from this package to tokenize and embed texts into word vectors.
